Dear Community,

On behalf of the Haxe Foundation, we are proud to announce the official release of the Haxe 4.0.0-rc.3! It is available along with the changelog at https://haxe.org/download.

The new Java Virtual Machine target is available! Generate JVM byte code directly from Haxe bypassing Java compilation step by adding `-D jvm` to your project targeting Java.

Unicode support was greatly improved across all targets.

Other than that, we fixed a lot of bugs and improved the quality of IDE services (compilation and completion server).

Also, we are considering different options about inline markup. The feature is subject to change in the future: https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe-evolution/issues/60

See the changelog below for further details. Please report any issues here: https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues

Thank you very much for your help!
