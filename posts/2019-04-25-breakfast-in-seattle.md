# Let's Have Breakfast in Seattle

Back in the day when Haxe was still young, the Google image search results for “Haxe” were the hottest SEO-problem to discuss at every Haxe Conference. You see, in Germany, a “Haxe” is a traditional knuckle roast. It looks like this:

Yummy, no?

Today, a couple of years later, the Google image search results for “Haxe” are much the same but we have decided to embrace the roast and just roll with it. At least now we know what to have for breakfast at the US Haxe Summit in Seattle in two weeks.

Here are some details about the event:

## Early Bird Pricing

We have decided to keep the early bird price of USD 299 because hey, it is spring and birds are cool. You can get your tickets here:

## Venue Change

The event has been moved to the FlowPlay office. It is right in the middle of Downtown Seattle and the decor is coming along nicely!
