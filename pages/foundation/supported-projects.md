# Supported Projects

The following software is supported by the Haxe Foundation:

* __The Haxe Compiler__ and __Standard Library__

	Aside from the compilation of Haxe projects, the compiler provides additional services such as autocompletion for IDEs and a compiler cache for faster compilations.

* __The Haxe Standard Library__

	The standard library provides a consistent set of classes that work across various platforms, as well as ways of interacting with whichever native environment you are compiling to.

	The [API Documentation](http://api.haxe.org) contains detailed specification of the expected behaviour of each class in the Standard Library.

* __Haxelib__

	Haxelib enables developers to share simple re-usable libraries between Haxe projects.

	The Haxelib command line tool integrates with the Haxe compiler to allow the compiler to include various libraries as requested.

	The Haxelib repository stores all uploaded libraries on a centralized server so they can be made available to other developers.

	The [Haxelib website](https://lib.haxe.org) provides a way to browse available Haxelibs through a web interface.
  
  
* __Neko and HashLink__

	[HashLink](https://hashlink.haxe.org) and [Neko](https://nekovm.org) are virtual machines created and maintained by the Haxe Foundation.
